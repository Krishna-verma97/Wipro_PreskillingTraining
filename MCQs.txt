Q1.
In Application Packaging, which method ensures that a registry or file-based configuration is reapplied for every new user login after a fresh install?
A) Logon Scripts
B) Scheduled Tasks
C) Active Setup Versioning.
D) MSI Custom Actions


C) Active Setup Versioning

Active Setup is specifically used to apply registry/file-based configurations per user after install, ensuring settings are re-applied for every new login.


Q2.
When handling MSI packaging, what is the correct difference between User Context and System Context?
A) User Context installs applications for all users, while System Context installs only for the logged-in user
B) User Context installs applications only for the logged-in user, while System Context installs for all users on the system.
C) Both contexts install applications system-wide, but only System Context requires admin privileges
D) User Context always bypasses permissions, while System Context enforces them


B) User Context installs applications only for the logged-in user, while System Context installs for all users on the system.

User Context → limited to the current logged-in user (stored under HKCU, user profile paths).

System Context → application is installed machine-wide for all users (stored under HKLM, Program Files, etc.).




Q3.
Which of the following Windows tools is primarily used to monitor and troubleshoot real-time registry and file system activities during MSI installation?
A) Process Explorer
B) RegMon.
C) AutoLogon
D) SysMon



B) RegMon

RegMon (Registry Monitor) was used earlier to track registry activity.
